    <p>JSHacks is an event dedicated to JavaScript developers and their communities.It brings together both novices and veterans alike and provides a supportive, collaborative and challenging environment with the aim of empowering individuals and nurturing communities.</p>
    <p>First edition takes place simultaneously in Bucharest/Romania and Chisinau/Moldova on 21-23 October, 2016.</p>
    <p>We invite all JavaScript meetup organizers and community leaders to join the initiative and facilitate the next JSHacks in your own local community. Get in touch and be part of the Global JSHacks community!</p>
